# MyChaoWorld
My Old Game Project 

This was an old game I used to work on by my myself. The premise of the game was to raise these creatures called 'chao'. They each have stats like power, fly, stamina, strength, etc. but in this version of the game they only have hunger, stamina, and power. I wrote this game in Java and it was my first time adding proper graphics to my game. The art isn't made by me and it's been so long that I don't remember who the artist was. Some sprites are from old video games while others are from google images. 

Here is an image of what the game looks like when compiled.
